		<p class="text"><strong>Lily was on the train, heading back home after visiting her grandparents. She was feeling a little bit down as she missed them already, and the train ride was getting a bit boring. As she looked out of the window, she noticed the sky was clearing up after a brief shower, and there, in the distance, she saw a rainbow. It was a beautiful sight, and for a moment, she forgot about her sadness and got lost in the vibrant colors of the rainbow.<strong></p>

Lily smiled to herself, feeling grateful to have seen one that day. She watched the rainbow as the train whizzed past it, and then it was gone.

		<p class="text"><strong>As she closed her eyes, Lily made a wish. She wished for a puppy to be her friend. She had always wanted a dog, but her parents had told her they lived in an apartment that wasn't big enough for a pet. But Lily knew in her heart that she could take care of a dog, and she promised to be the best owner she could be if she ever got one.

Suddenly, she heard a dog barking, and to her surprise, her parents revealed that they had bought her a puppy as a birthday gift. Lily was over the moon with joy and hugged her new furry friend, who licked her face in response. She named the puppy Rainbow, in honor of the rainbow she had seen on the train ride home. From that day on, Lily and Rainbow were inseparable, and Lily knew that her wish had come true. </strong></p>
