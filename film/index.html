      		<p><strong>&#9749;Increased alertness and focus:</strong> Coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant that can help improve focus and concentration. This can be particularly helpful for students who need to stay alert during long study sessions or lectures.

			<p><strong>&#9749;Improved memory and cognitive function: </strong>Some studies have shown that caffeine can also help improve memory and cognitive function, which can be beneficial for students who need to retain a lot of information for exams or projects. </p>

			<p><strong>&#9749;Boosted energy:</strong> Coffee can provide a quick energy boost that can help students power through their day, especially when they have a lot on their plate. </p>

			<p><strong>&#9749;Social benefits: </strong>Coffee can also be a great way to connect with others, whether it's meeting up with friends at a local coffee shop or bonding with fellow coffee lovers in a student-led club like CoffeeHub. </p>
