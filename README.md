Our coffee-themed short film inspired me to create a website for a student club of coffee lovers. The website provides information about the club and invites students to join. Generally, the film serves as a promotional video for the club.

First of all, it was really helpful to have a particular wireframe, which guided throughout the process of creating the website. There are overwhelmingly many features in HTML and CSS that I was thinking of trying out. However, this takes a lot of time, and would create more issues eventually. Thus, a wireframe helped me to stay focused on my initial layout and visuals. The initial idea was to create a website which gives more information as you scroll down. 

Secondly, CSS positioning is painful. But I found W3Schools website to be a very useful resource in explaining the fundamentals of web design. I used a template of a simple website from there, but I modified it accordingly. However, when I added a scrolling feature with a fixed navigation bar, the position of many components changed. Thus, I spent a lot of time organizing a websiteâ€™s layout to ensure that it is functionally responsive. 

I'm pleased with the website! It was a great introductory assignment to the fundamentals of web development. Now I think it is easier for me to navigate through many features of HTML, CSS and JavaScript after understanding the general picture and structure of a website. 

I hope to learn more about cool features of JavaScript to create more interactive and user-friendly websites!
